## Introduction to HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating web pages. It describes the structure of a webpage using a series of elements, which are represented by tags.

## Basic HTML Structure

Every HTML document follows a basic structure. Here's an example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"> <!-- Linking to CSS -->
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Webpage</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### Explanation:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the document type and version of HTML.
- `<html>`: The root element that wraps all the content on the page.
- `<head>`: Contains meta-information about the document, like its title and linked stylesheets.
- `<title>`: Sets the title of the webpage, which appears on the browser tab.
- `<body>`: Contains the content that will be displayed on the webpage.

## Common HTML Tags

Here are some commonly used HTML tags:

- `<h1> to <h6>`: Headings, with `<h1>` being the most important.
- `<p>`: Paragraphs.
- `<a href="">`: Links to other pages.
- `<img src="" alt="">`: Embeds images.
- `<ul>`: Unordered lists, using `<li>` for each list item.
- `<ol>`: Ordered lists.

## Introduction to CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style HTML elements. It allows you to control the look and feel of your webpage, including layout, colors, fonts, and more.

## Linking CSS to HTML

To style your HTML document with CSS, you need to link a CSS file to your HTML document. This is done using the `<link>` tag inside the `<head>` section.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
```

### Explanation:

- `rel="stylesheet"`: Specifies the relationship between the HTML document and the linked file.
- `href="styles.css"`: The path to the CSS file. If the CSS file is in the same directory as the HTML file, you just need the filename.

## Basic CSS Syntax

CSS rules are composed of selectors and declarations.

```css
selector {
    property: value;
}
```

### Example:

```css
body {
    background-color: lightblue;
}

h1 {
    color: navy;
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}
```

### Explanation:

- `selector`: Targets the HTML element(s) you want to style.
- `property`: Specifies the CSS property you want to change (e.g., color, background-color).
- `value`: Sets the value for the property (e.g., `lightblue`, `navy`).

## CSS Selectors

CSS selectors allow you to target HTML elements for styling. Here are some basic selectors:

- `element` (e.g., `p`): Selects all elements of a specific type.
- `.class` (e.g., `.intro`): Selects all elements with a specific class.
- `#id` (e.g., `#main`): Selects the element with a specific ID.

### Example:

```css
/* Selects all <p> elements */
p {
    color: green;
}

/* Selects all elements with class "intro" */
.intro {
    font-size: 20px;
}

/* Selects the element with ID "main" */
#main {
    margin: 20px;
}
```

## Styling HTML Elements

Now that you understand the basics of CSS, let's style our HTML document.

```css
body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    background-color: #f4f4f4;
    color: #333;
    line-height: 1.6;
}

h1 {
    color: #555;
}

p {
    margin-bottom: 10px;
}

a {
    color: blue;
    text-decoration: none;
}

a:hover {
    text-decoration: underline;
}
```

### Explanation:

- `body`: Styles applied to the entire page.
- `h1`: Styles applied to all `<h1>` headings.
- `p`: Styles applied to all paragraphs.
- `a`: Styles applied to all links. The `:hover` selector styles the link when the user hovers over it.
