## Introduction to HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundation of web development. It structures the content on the web, allowing browsers to display text, images, videos, and other media. Each element on a webpage is defined by HTML tags.

## Basic HTML Document Structure

Every HTML document has a standard structure. Here's a breakdown of an HTML document:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Webpage</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>Welcome to My Webpage</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <section>
            <p>This is a section of text in my webpage.</p>
        </section>
    </main>
    <footer>
        <p>&copy; 2024 My Webpage</p>
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

### Explanation:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the document type, ensuring the document is rendered in standards mode.
- `<html>`: The root element, containing all other elements.
- `<head>`: Contains meta-information, such as the character set, viewport settings, title, and links to stylesheets or scripts.
- `<title>`: Sets the title shown in the browser's tab.
- `<body>`: Contains the content of the webpage, visible to users.

## Common HTML Elements

### Headings

Headings are used to define the structure of content. There are six levels of headings, from `<h1>` (most important) to `<h6>` (least important).

```html
<h1>Main Heading</h1>
<h2>Subheading</h2>
<h3>Section Heading</h3>
```

### Paragraphs

Paragraphs are used to display blocks of text.

```html
<p>This is a paragraph of text. It provides information in a block format, making it easy to read.</p>
```

### Links

Links (anchors) allow navigation to other pages or sections within the same page.

```html
<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>
```

- `href`: The destination URL.
- Links can open in a new tab using `target="_blank"`.

### Images

Images are embedded using the `<img>` tag.

```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
```

- `src`: The path to the image file.
- `alt`: Alternative text for screen readers or when the image can't be displayed.

### Lists

HTML supports ordered and unordered lists.

#### Unordered List

```html
<ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>
```

#### Ordered List

```html
<ol>
    <li>First Item</li>
    <li>Second Item</li>
    <li>Third Item</li>
</ol>
```

### Tables

Tables are used to display data in rows and columns.

```html
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Header 1</th>
        <th>Header 2</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Data 1</td>
        <td>Data 2</td>
    </tr>
</table>
```

- `<tr>`: Table row.
- `<th>`: Table header.
- `<td>`: Table data.

## Introduction to CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) controls the presentation of HTML elements. It allows you to apply styles like color, font size, and layout to your webpage.

## Linking CSS to HTML

### External CSS

External CSS is linked using the `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
```

### Internal CSS

Internal CSS is written inside the `<style>` tag within the `<head>` section.

```html
<head>
    <style>
        body {
            background-color: lightgray;
        }
    </style>
</head>
```

### Inline CSS

Inline CSS is applied directly to HTML elements using the `style` attribute.

```html
<p style="color: blue;">This is a blue paragraph.</p>
```

## CSS Syntax and Selectors

### CSS Syntax

CSS is written in rulesets, which consist of selectors and declarations.

```css
selector {
    property: value;
}
```

### Types of Selectors

#### Element Selector

Targets all elements of a given type.

```css
p {
    color: green;
}
```

#### Class Selector

Targets elements with a specific class attribute.

```css
.intro {
    font-size: 18px;
}
```

#### ID Selector

Targets an element with a specific ID attribute.

```css
#main-header {
    background-color: #333;
    color: #fff;
}
```

### Specificity

Specificity determines which CSS rule is applied when multiple rules could apply to the same element. It is calculated based on the types of selectors used.

- IDs have the highest specificity.
- Classes have a lower specificity.
- Element selectors have the lowest specificity.

## CSS Box Model

The CSS box model describes the rectangular boxes generated for elements in the document tree.

### Margin

The margin is the space outside the border of an element.

```css
div {
    margin: 20px;
}
```

### Border

The border surrounds the padding and content of an element.

```css
div {
    border: 2px solid black;
}
```

### Padding

Padding is the space between the content and the border of an element.

```css
div {
    padding: 10px;
}
```

### Content

The content area is where text and images are displayed.

## CSS Positioning

### Static Positioning

Elements are positioned according to the normal document flow.

```css
div {
    position: static;
}
```

### Relative Positioning

Elements are positioned relative to their normal position.

```css
div {
    position: relative;
    top: 10px;
    left: 20px;
}
```

### Absolute Positioning

Elements are positioned relative to their nearest positioned ancestor.

```css
div {
    position: absolute;
    top: 50px;
    left: 100px;
}
```

### Fixed Positioning

Elements are positioned relative to the browser window.

```css
div {
    position: fixed;
    bottom: 0;
    right: 0;
}
```

### Sticky Positioning

Elements are positioned based on the user's scroll position.

```css
div {
    position: sticky;
    top: 0;
}
```

## CSS Flexbox

Flexbox is a layout model that allows responsive design by distributing space and aligning items within a container.

### Example:

```css
.container {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
}

.item {
    flex: 1;
    padding: 10px;
}
```

### Explanation:

- `display: flex`: Defines a flex container.
- `justify-content`: Aligns items horizontally within the container.
- `flex`: Defines how a flex item will grow or shrink.

## CSS Grid

CSS Grid is a layout system optimized for 2D layout, offering greater control over rows and columns.

### Example:

```css
.grid-container {
    display: grid;
   

 grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
    gap: 10px;
}

.grid-item {
    background-color: lightblue;
    padding: 20px;
}
```

### Explanation:

- `grid-template-columns`: Defines the number and size of columns.
- `gap`: Specifies the spacing between grid items.
